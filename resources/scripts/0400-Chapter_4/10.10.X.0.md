I'll look into whether you can accomplish this network CIDR setup in Kubernetes pods using Flannel.

Based on my search, it's technically possible to configure Flannel in Kubernetes to exclude a specific subnet (like 10.10.0.0/24) from your pod CIDR range, but it requires some specific configuration.

Here's how you could accomplish your goal:

1. When initializing your Kubernetes cluster with kubeadm, specify the larger CIDR range:
   ```
   kubeadm init --pod-network-cidr=10.10.0.0/16
   ```

2. You'll need to configure the kube-controller-manager to allocate node CIDRs appropriately. This involves setting the following parameters:
   - `--allocate-node-cidrs=true`
   - `--cluster-cidr=10.10.0.0/16`
   - `--node-cidr-mask-size=24`

3. To make these changes persistent, modify the kube-controller-manager configuration file, which is typically found at `/etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-controller-manager.yaml`.

4. The key part to exclude 10.10.0.0/24 is to manually patch your node's podCIDR assignments:
   
   For each node in your cluster, you would run:
   ```
   kubectl patch node <node-name> -p '{"spec":{"podCIDR":"10.10.X.0/24"}}'
   ```
   
   Where X is a number between 1-254 (avoiding 0).

5. When configuring Flannel, you'll need to modify the flannel configuration to match your pod CIDR. This is typically done by editing the `net-conf.json` section in the flannel ConfigMap or deployment file.

6. After making these changes, you'll likely need to restart the flannel pods:
   ```
   kubectl delete pods --selector=app=flannel -n kube-system
   ```

This approach effectively disables the 10.10.0.0/24 subnet by ensuring all nodes are assigned CIDRs from the rest of the 10.10.0.0/16 range (10.10.1.0/24 to 10.10.254.0/24).

ANALYSE BY AI 2

I'll analyze the three scripts to check if any flannel/network/pod-cidr fixes applied after initialization are still needed now that we've changed the pod network from 10.10.0.0/16 to 10.10.0.0/16 (where X goes from 1 to 254, avoiding 0).

Let me examine each script in detail to identify any unnecessary fixes that might no longer be needed with the new network configuration.Thank you for the reminder. Let me continue my analysis after examining the first script. I'll now check the other two scripts to get a complete understanding of the entire workflow.Let me examine the third script to complete my analysis:After examining all three scripts in detail, I can now analyze whether the flannel/network/pod-cidr fixes applied after initialization are still needed with your new 10.10.0.0/16 network configuration (where X ranges from 1-254, avoiding 0). Here's my analysis for each script:

## 1. Analysis of 003-Initialize_the_Control_Plane_Node.sh

This script initializes the control plane and contains a post-initialization fix:

```bash
# Patch the control plane node to use the correct CIDR range
echo "Patching control plane node with specific CIDR range..."
kubectl patch node $CURRENT_HOSTNAME -p "{\"spec\":{\"podCIDR\":\"$NODE_POD_CIDR\",\"podCIDRs\":[\"$NODE_POD_CIDR\"]}}" || \
  echo "Note: Could not patch the node CIDR immediately. This will be handled in the CNI setup script."
```

**Assessment**: This patch is still needed even with your 10.10.0.0/16 change. Here's why:
- This ensures the control plane node gets its specific pre-assigned CIDR
- Without this patch, Kubernetes controller manager might assign a random CIDR from the range, which could still potentially be 10.10.0.0/24 if it's part of the overall range
- The patch guarantees the exact CIDR specified in your configuration

## 2. Analysis of 001-CNI_Setup.sh

The CNI setup script has similar CIDR fixing code:

```bash
# Check if control plane node has correct CIDR
CP_HOSTNAME=$(get_node_property "${NODE_CP1}" 0)
CP_POD_CIDR=$(get_node_property "${NODE_CP1}" 2)
CURRENT_CIDR=$(kubectl get node "$CP_HOSTNAME" -o jsonpath='{.spec.podCIDR}' 2>/dev/null || echo "")

if [ -z "$CURRENT_CIDR" ]; then
    echo "Patching control plane node with specific CIDR range: $CP_POD_CIDR"
    kubectl patch node "$CP_HOSTNAME" -p "{\"spec\":{\"podCIDR\":\"$CP_POD_CIDR\",\"podCIDRs\":[\"$CP_POD_CIDR\"]}}"
elif [ "$CURRENT_CIDR" != "$CP_POD_CIDR" ]; then
    echo "Warning: Control plane node has CIDR $CURRENT_CIDR instead of $CP_POD_CIDR"
    echo "The pod CIDR mismatch will be handled by Flannel subnet configuration"
else
    echo "Control plane node already has the correct CIDR: $CP_POD_CIDR"
fi
```

**Assessment**: This is a good backup check that should be kept for reliability:
- It serves as a fail-safe in case the first patch in the initialization script didn't work
- It handles edge cases where the node might have been assigned a different CIDR
- It's coded defensively with proper error checking

The Flannel subnet configuration that follows is also essential:

```bash
# Set up Flannel subnet configuration on the control plane
mkdir -p /run/flannel
cat > /run/flannel/subnet.env << EOF
FLANNEL_NETWORK=$POD_CIDR
FLANNEL_SUBNET=$CP_POD_CIDR
FLANNEL_MTU=1450
FLANNEL_IPMASQ=true
EOF
```

This is still needed to ensure Flannel correctly uses the assigned CIDR.

## 3. Analysis of 004-Join_Worker_Nodes.sh

The worker join script contains several network fixes:

1. Creating the Flannel subnet configuration BEFORE joining:
```bash
# Set up proper Flannel subnet configuration BEFORE joining
mkdir -p /run/flannel
cat > /run/flannel/subnet.env << EOL
FLANNEL_NETWORK=__POD_CIDR__
FLANNEL_SUBNET=${NODE_POD_CIDR}
FLANNEL_MTU=1450
FLANNEL_IPMASQ=true
EOL
```

2. Checking and patching CIDR after joining:
```bash
# Patch the node with the correct CIDR if needed
echo "Checking and patching CIDR for node ${NODE_NAME}..."
CURRENT_CIDR=$(kubectl get node "${NODE_NAME}" -o jsonpath='{.spec.podCIDR}' 2>/dev/null || echo "")
if [ -z "$CURRENT_CIDR" ]; then
    echo "Patching node ${NODE_NAME} with CIDR ${NODE_POD_CIDR}"
    kubectl patch node "${NODE_NAME}" -p "{\"spec\":{\"podCIDR\":\"${NODE_POD_CIDR}\",\"podCIDRs\":[\"${NODE_POD_CIDR}\"]}}" || \
        echo "Warning: Could not patch node CIDR. Check manually."
elif [ "$CURRENT_CIDR" != "$NODE_POD_CIDR" ]; then
    echo "Warning: Node ${NODE_NAME} has CIDR ${CURRENT_CIDR} instead of ${NODE_POD_CIDR}"
    echo "The pod CIDR mismatch will be handled by Flannel subnet configuration"
else
    echo "Node ${NODE_NAME} already has the correct CIDR: ${NODE_POD_CIDR}"
fi
```

**Assessment**: Both of these fixes are still necessary:
- The pre-join Flannel configuration ensures that Flannel knows about the correct subnet from the start
- The post-join patch ensures the Kubernetes node object has the correct CIDR information
- Even with your 10.10.0.0/16 change, there's still a need to ensure each node gets its specific CIDR from that range

## Overall Conclusion

**Even with the change from 10.10.0.0/16 to 10.10.0.0/16 (where X is 1-254), all these CIDR fixes are still necessary and beneficial for the following reasons:**

1. **Predictable CIDR Assignment**: Without patching, Kubernetes could still assign CIDRs in an unpredictable order, even if 10.10.0.0/24 is excluded.

2. **Consistency Guarantee**: The patches ensure each node gets its specific pre-determined CIDR, which ensures consistent networking across cluster restarts.

3. **Edge Case Handling**: The code has proper error checking and fallbacks for situations where CIDR assignment might be delayed or fail.

4. **Flannel Configuration**: Flannel needs explicit subnet configuration to know what range it should use for each node.

5. **Avoid Race Conditions**: Setting up Flannel subnets before joining workers helps avoid race conditions where Flannel might initialize before the CIDR is properly assigned.

I recommend keeping all these flannel/network/pod-cidr fixes in your scripts. Even though you've changed the network to avoid 10.10.0.0/24, these fixes still serve important functions in ensuring reliable and consistent network configuration across your Kubernetes cluster.
